### Front End Portfolio Project

I created a new portfolio for Bryana using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. She said she wanted a pink and blue, girly but grown up, soft and airy site so I created the watercolor image and favicon in Photoshop and made the animated menu icon.

This was a lot of fun and a great way for me stretch/grow on the design side of web development!
